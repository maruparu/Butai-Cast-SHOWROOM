# 舞台 Cast SHOWROOM

Building on Showroom Live Watcher from @wlerin, these are the additional scripts for archiving SHOWROOM streams of 舞台 cast (mainly ハイステ).

Requirement : https://github.com/wlerin/showroom

### How to use?
If you have no interested in archiving AKB48 SHOWROOM, you can simply delete all the .jdex file in the "index" folder that you have obtained from @wlerin's Showroom Live Watcher. Then you can replace them with the SHOWROOM that you want to archive from this repository.
