# 舞台 Cast SHOWROOM

Building on Showroom Live Watcher from @wlerin, these are the additional scripts for archiving SHOWROOM streams from 舞台 cast.

Requirement : https://github.com/wlerin/showroom

### How to use?
If you have no interested in archiving AKB48 SHOWROOM, you can simply delete all the .jdex file in the "index" folder.
Then you can select the SHOWROOM that you want to archive from this repository and place it in "index" folder instead.
